Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the building of software that is reliable for coding, and that solves real life problems.
It enables coding, development of applications and websites, and it helps solve real life problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software Crisis - the software in this period used to have delays, and cost overruns. This was the beginning of the programming we have today.
Object Oriented PL's Boom - c++ language that was derived from c and Simula were developed.
Emergence of frameworks - emergence of Netbeans, VS Code and Java.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Planning: Begins the whole phase.
    Analysis: Involves geting a complete description of the problem and requirements. 
    Design: Involves coming up with a model of the system to be developed. 
    Development: Involves developing the software(coding is involved here).
    Implementation: Involves having the result as an executable program.
    Testing: Involves errordetection and refining the code used to develop the software
    Maintenance: Involves maintaining the software through ways that the software neto beis a  kept functional.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential. Example: when you want to develop a system that is not complex. 
Agile methodology- is an adaptive method. Mostly used in adaptive planning, evolutionary development and continous to change models.
example: when developing a complex system that needs adjustments. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:
Develops software
Evaluates software.
Validates software.
Provides the specifications of the software.

a Quality Assurance Engineer:
Test planning – Develop test plans, test cases, and test scripts for applications.
Testing – Perform functional, performance, and security testing.
Bug tracking and reporting – Identify defects and document them.
Code quality assurance – Collaborate with developers to improve code quality through reviews and best practices.
Ensuring compliance – Ensure software meets industry standards, security requirements, and company guidelines.


a Project Manager:
develops project plan
builds project team
manages risks
resourse allocation and management
project delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE
Importances:
Ensures
code efficiency and productivity through features such as auto-completion.
error detection and debugging.
Make it easier to navigate and structure code.
Developers can run, compile, and test programs directly within the IDE.
Examples: VS Code

VCS
Importances: 
Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.
Every change is recorded, so developers can restore previous versions if something goes wrong.
Developers can create separate branches to test new features and merge them back when ready.
Prevents accidental loss of code and ensures only reviewed and approved changes are merged.
Example: Github 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and fixing bugs. use debugging tools such as Chrome DevTools.
Rapid technology growth challenge. Learn throughout to catch up with new trends.
Tight deadlines - set realistic time estimates.
Security vulnerabilities - implement authentication and encryption for sensitive data.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Each individual software component is tested.
Integration testing - tests the interaction between modules. 
System testing - the whole software is tested.
Acceptance testing - done before its release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to optimize interactions with AI models, such as Gemini.

Importance:
 Well-crafted prompts help AI generate precise and contextually appropriate responses.
 Users can communicate more effectively with AI by structuring prompts clearly.
 AI can generate better ideas, summaries, or code solutions when given detailed prompts.
 Reducing back-and-forth clarification saves time and enhances productivity.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: write me a poem.
an improved prompt: write a short, rhyming poem about the beauty of a sunrise over the ocean, capturing the peaceful atmosphere and vibrant colors.
the latter is more effective because it's more specific hence receiving precise details of the poem.
